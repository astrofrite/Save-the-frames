# Save-the-frames
Hi ! Here its the "save the frame project", i started it back in late march of 2020, but then i lost inspiration and didn't do much, i restart it now that i joined the "Godo Wild Jam", so i got back to work on it, and now its much better, with properly working character and mechanics, so thats it, feel free to make sugestion !
